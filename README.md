# deskercise-ai
Deskercise-AI is your personal trainer that provides step-by-step guidance for each exercise and progression, and your plan adapts over time as you complete.

It uses [Movenet](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/movenet/) to detect body joint points and score users based on the exercising moves.
